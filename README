This directory contains a series of emacs helpers, and some code to
make them all load automatically (with thanks to Era Eriksson for
originally writing my-site-start).

Adding a file with a name like NN-foo.el here (where NN is a 2-digit
number, and foo is any name -- but see my-site-start docs for full
details), or within a subdirectory of this directory, will
automatically cause it to get run provided that that:

(1) You've checked this out into ~/.emacs.d/emacs-helpers/ (or you
    adjust the last line in (3) according to where you've checked it out)

(2) You've checked out out a copy of my-site-start into ~/.emacs.d/my-site-start

    To do this, if you have darcs (a revision control system), you can
    run, from within ~/.emacs.d/:

        darcs get http://porkmail.org/elisp/my-site-start/

    see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsModular for more info

    Note: I may very well incorporate my-site-start into this tree
    directly at some point; I figure I'll attempt to contact Era
    first, though, to hopefully avoid un-necessary forks.

    I might also want to bail on this whole idea in favor of
    incorporating https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/
    ... but I need to take a closer look at that, first.

(3) You've added the following lines (or something equivalent) into
    your ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el file:

---- snip ----
;;; Emacs Load Path
(setq load-path (cons "~/.emacs.d" load-path))

;;;; break things up into individual files:
; see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsModular
(autoload 'my-site-start "my-site-start/my-site-start" nil t)
(my-site-start "~/.emacs.d/emacs-helpers/")
